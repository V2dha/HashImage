# Problem Statement
Centralized image-sharing platform creators have full control over what content is shown to the user. These platforms have algorithms that effectively censor users by hiding certain content and sharing specific content to the users according to what the creator thinks is best and lacks transparency. 

Apart from this, various content creators often post their content in the form of art, photographs or memes which do get applauded in the form of likes, comments and reach but there is no real-time transparent method to earn through the content uploaded by them.

# Project Working
The idea is to create a Decentralized Image-Sharing application where content creators or users can earn in celo cryptocurrency by posting images in the form of art, photographs or even memes. 

All the images uploaded are stored on a decentralized file storage system called IPFS so the images are be fully censorship-resistant and there is only one transparent algorithm that is defined in the smart contract and is immutable.

After the image is posted, users can pay the content creators if they like the content using their celo wallet.
